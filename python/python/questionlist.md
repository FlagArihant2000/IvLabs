1. program1.py - Write a program to print hello world.

2. program2.py - Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour to compute gross pay.

3. program31.py - Rewrite your pay computation to give the employee 1.5 times the hourly rate for hours worked above 40 hours.

4. program32.py - Rewrite your pay program using try and except so that your program handles non-numeric input gracefully by printing a message and exiting the program. 

5. program4.py - Rewrite your pay computation with time-and-a-half for overtime and create a function called computepay which takes two parameters (hours and rate).

6. program5.py - Write another program that prompts for a list of numbers as above and at the end prints out both the maximum and minimum of the numbers instead of the average.

7. program6.py - Take the following Python code that stores a string:

str = 'X-DSPAM-Confidence:0.8475'

Use find and string slicing to extract the portion of the string after the colon character and then use the float function to convert the extracted string into a floating point number.
