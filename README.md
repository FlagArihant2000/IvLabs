1) assignment1.c - The problem is the extension of the rod cutting problem, given that we have standard sizes with prices, we have to cut a rod of length n inches in such a way that the selling price is maximum. The logic behind the problem is that the greatest price rate for a standard length is given higher priority.


2) assignment2.c - Given an array of integers where each element represents the max number of steps that can be made forward from that element. Write a function which returns the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array. The logic behind the problem is that the element between the initial element and the longest jump it can make from there, is taken into consideration. The maximum between the two is the element at which the control should jump. In this way, in all probabilities, the control might not encounter a zero, else it won't be possible for the program to end.
